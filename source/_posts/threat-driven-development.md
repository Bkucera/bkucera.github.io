**We've all heard of TDD**, but you just don't hear about *Threat Driven Development*  in the tech industry anymore.
With more and more companies stressing well documented APIs, Open Source projects, and improved :v:Developer Experience:v:, the tech industry is on the cusp of a cortisol shortage and imminent stagnation.
**Threat Driven Development** has the potential **to solve this issue**- but only if reintroduced into the developer ecosystem in a trendy, **millennial-friendly** way.

#### I think it's about time we bring it back  :thumbsup:


### A quick refresher
**Threat Driven Development** is the imposing of pre-defined consequences of the failing of a task for the purpose of increasing motivation for it. These consequences are entirely contrived and don't particularly have anything to do with the organic consequences of the failure.

### A way forward
Thankfully, the rise of **Continuous Integration Systems** has also created much of the infrastructure that's need to keep us all entirely accountable.
